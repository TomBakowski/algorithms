# Algorithms and Big O Notation: A Quick Tutorial

## Introduction to Algorithms in Programming

**Algorithms** are a fundamental aspect of programming. They are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. The quality of an algorithm is not only judged by the correctness of its output but also by its efficiency in terms of time and memory usage. In programming, algorithms are implemented as functions or methods in various programming languages and are used to manipulate data, perform calculations, and solve specific computational problems.

## Understanding Big O Notation

Big O Notation is a mathematical concept used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Specifically, it provides an upper bound on the time or space (memory) requirements of an algorithm in the worst-case scenario, which helps in understanding the scalability and efficiency of the algorithm.

### Important Concepts

- **Growth is with respect to the input:** The time complexity of an algorithm is typically expressed in terms of its growth rate as the size of the input increases. This is often represented using Big O notation. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) grows linearly with the size of the input.

- **Constants are dropped:** When expressing time complexity, we're usually interested in the growth rate of the algorithm as the input size increases, not the exact number of operations. Therefore, constants and smaller terms are often dropped in Big O notation. For example, if an algorithm takes 2n + 10 operations, we would say it has a time complexity of O(n), not O(2n + 10).

- **Worst-case analysis:** When analyzing an algorithm's time complexity, we typically focus on the worst-case scenario. This provides an upper bound on the algorithm's runtime, helping us understand its performance under challenging conditions.

- **Average case complexity:** While worst-case complexity gives us an upper bound, average-case complexity describes how the algorithm performs on average. However, it's often more difficult to calculate because it requires knowledge about the distribution of all possible inputs.

- **Best case complexity:** This is the lower bound of the time complexity, representing the minimum amount of time the algorithm will take. However, it's generally not as useful as the worst-case and average-case complexity, because it represents an ideal scenario that may not occur often in practice.

- **Space complexity:** In addition to time complexity, it's also important to consider an algorithm's space complexity, or the amount of memory it requires. Like time complexity, space complexity is often expressed in Big O notation.

### Big O Complexity Classes

- **O(1) - Constant Time:** The algorithm takes the same amount of time to complete, regardless of the input size.

  - Popular Algorithms:

- **O((E+V)logV) - Log-linear Time (E is the number of edges, V is the number of vertices):** The time complexity of this algorithm is log-linear, meaning it increases logarithmically with the number of edges and vertices in the input. This complexity is often seen in algorithms that involve graph traversal or sorting.

  - Popular Algorithms:
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  
- **O(ElogE) or O(ElogV) - Log-linear Time (E is the number of edges, V is the number of vertices):** This time complexity indicates that the algorithm's performance grows logarithmically with the number of edges (E) or vertices (V) in the input. It is commonly used in algorithms that involve sorting or searching operations.

- **Data Structures:** Ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They often affect an algorithm's performance.

  Here are some commonly used data structures:

  - **Array:** A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Elements can be accessed using their index.

  - **Linked List:** A collection of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node.

  - **Stack:** A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be added or removed only from the top.

The solution to the original problem is then computed using the solutions to the sub-problems.

- **Recursion:** A method of solving problems where the solution to a particular instance of a problem is derived from the solution of smaller instances of the same problem. It involves a function calling itself until a base case is reached.
